Contributing
============

The New York Times team welcomes contributions of all kinds, from simple bug
reports through documentation, test cases, bug fixes, and features.

Testing
-------

Please ensure that any changes include tests to exercise functionality.


Coding Style
------------

Please follow the Clojure [community style guide][1].


Workflow
--------

We love Github issues! Before working on any new features, please open an issue
so that we can agree on the direction, and hopefully avoid investing a lot of
time on a feature that might need reworking.

Small pull requests for things like typos, bug fixes, etc are always welcome.

Please note that we will not accept pull requests for style changes.
